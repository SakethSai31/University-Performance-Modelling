# UNIVERSITY PERFORMANCE MODEL

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this Project is to turn an object model into a machine for information gathering and data aggregation.

## OVERVIEW
The task of this model is to build a performance measurement solution to enable universities to measure the quality of the education they deliver to their students. 

The approach will investigate how an educational system in terms of faculty and courses contribute to the growth of their graduates over a 5-year period. 

It also helps to track the jobs and promotions graduates get over time and assign rankings accordingly.
